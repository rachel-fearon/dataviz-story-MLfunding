          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>In Connecticut, <a href="https://internal-search.ecs.org/comparisons/50-state-comparison-english-learner-policies-05">Multilingual learners</a> (MLs) are defined as public school students whose primary language is not English and whose English proficiency poses a barrier to equitable learning in the regular school program. Massachusetts, similarly, defines MLs as any student who does not speak English or whose primary language is not English and who is unable to satisfactorily complete classwork in English. English learners are also commonly referred to as English learners (ELs) and English language learners (ELLs). Our partners at the School & State Finance Project are particularly interested in improving the data available for ML funding to address the insufficient reporting and allocation of finances in Connecticut, which is necessary to prepare MLs for educational opportunities and success.</p>

          <p>Educational funding for MLs ensures that students and educators have the resources to remove linguistic barriers to prioritize accessible education and maximize long-term success. The purpose of this data story is to answer two questions aimed at addressing improved funding for MLs:</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
            1) How are MLs distributed across school districts in MA; what are the language differences amongst MLs in CT and MA public school districts?
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
            2) Do district spending levels rise with the percentage of Multilingual Learners in districts across CT and MA?
          </p>
        <p>
          In response to the first question, we found that in <a href="https://www.mgrsd.org/contact/pupil-services/english-language-learners">Massachusetts</a>, 90% of school districts have at least one ML student; however, 19% of all districts have at least 100 MLs. Similarly, 7% of <a href="https://schoolstatefinance.org/hubfs/Reports/MLL%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf">Connecticut</a> school districts have over 20% of MLs in their student population.
Equitable funding signifies that the money allotted to ML programs is proportional to the percentage of MLs within each district. This is in contrast to having equal funding for all districts without accounting for the change in need across districts.
<br>
Regarding the second question, our key finding is that CT overall has a higher PPE for MLs compared to MA; however, in a district-level comparison, CT districts with a higher percentage of MLs have a lower PPE. Comparatively, Massachusetts has a small, though negligible, positive correlation between ML percentage and PE.

Based on these results, our findings suggest that Connecticut and Massachusetts do not equitably distribute funding across districts with higher percentages of multilingual learners. Such inequities contribute to the widening achievement gaps that necessitate the demands for improved ML funding.

          <h2>Background</h2>

          <p>According to the <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/sde/board/boardmaterials050124/the_condition_of_education_in_connecticut_2022_23.pdf">Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE)</a>, the most common non-English languages spoken by MLs are Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Haitian Creole, and Mandarin. As per the <a href="https://miracoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Language-Access-Factsheet-MIRA-Coalition-2023.pdf">MIRA 2023 report</a>, in Massachusetts, the top non-English languages are Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese (including Mandarin and Cantonese), Haitian Creole, and Vietnamese. MLs are identified in a four-step process as outlined by the <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/sde/student-assessment/special-populations/csde-elml-identification-flowchart-grades-k-12-april-2024.pdf">CSDE’s Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)</a> and <a href="https://www.doe.mass.edu/ele/resources/communications.html">ACCESS for ELs</a>. Upon registering as a student in a public school, students are assessed using the <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/SDE/Student-Assessment/Special-Populations/CT-HLS_Survey_Template-revised-3722.pdf">Home Language Survey (HLS)</a> to determine if they are a potential ML. Following the second step, in which HLS results are reviewed, students who have a primary/home language other than English are administered the English Language Proficiency (ELP) screener. In the final step of identification, the results of the ELP screener indicate whether or not the student should be identified as an ML. Once identified as an ML, the students’ parents/guardians are informed of their language service options and are able to choose which services, if any, they opt into.</p>
          
          <h2>Why Equitable Funding Matters</h2>
          
          <p>Funding for MLs ensures equitable learning opportunities for the ML students who make up an increasing proportion of public school students, in both <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/sde/board/boardmaterials050124/the_condition_of_education_in_connecticut_2022_23.pdf">Connecticut</a> and <a href="https://www.doe.mass.edu/ele/families/#:~:text=ELs%20represent%20over%2010%25%20of,their%20native%20English%2Dspeaking%20peers.">Massachusetts</a>. Notably, districts in Hartford and New Haven serve ML students who speak <a href="https://edsight.ct.gov/relatedreports/Condition%20of%20Education%202022-23.pdf">over 50 unique languages</a> at home. In the states of Connecticut and Massachusetts, funding for elementary-secondary education is sourced from federal grants, state funds, and local funds (US Census Bureau). <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/SDE/English-Learners/Bilingual-Education">Connecticut’s Bilingual Education Program</a> and <a href="https://www.doe.mass.edu/ele/programs/tbe.html">Massachusetts’s Transitional Bilingual Education Program</a> are designed to help students become proficient in English, such that they are able to master the same academic content as their peers. Both programs use English as the instructional language to facilitate this learning. By understanding the funding that is available for the Bilingual Education Programs, the Transitional Bilingual Education Program, and other school-based support, we can better understand how multilingual funding varies across different school districts in Connecticut and Massachusetts.</p>

          <h2>Findings</h2>

          <p>In making a comparison between Massachusetts and Connecticut, it’s important to acknowledge the population difference. According to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE), there were <a href="https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/statereport/enrollmentbygrade.aspx"> 915,932</a> students enrolled across public districts in the 2024-2025 fiscal year (Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education). This compares to Connecticut’s <a href="https://public-edsight.ct.gov/students/enrollment-dashboard?language=en_US">508,402</a> students across public districts (EdSight). However, both states have similar percentages of multilingual and non-multilingual learners across the state in the 2024-25 fiscal year. In each state, over a tenth of the student population is multilingual learners. This high percentage shows the significance of ML programs and addressing equitable funding.</p>

          <p> <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/eYFN3/">Fig 1.</a> Percent of English Learners in CT and MA Districts 2024-2025 Fiscal Year</p>
          <p>The bar chart shows the percentage of English learners in CT and MA school districts. Connecticut has 11.3% English learners, while Massachusetts has 13.9%. This data gives background about the ML student population in CT and MA, and serves as a foundation for understanding the variation in funding within each state.</p>

          <p> <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sCRl3/?v=6">Table 1a.</a> Percentage of MLs by MA District</p>
          <p>This table shows the number and percentages of MLs in Massachusetts districts. There is a wide range of percentages. Phoenix Academy Charter Public High School has the highest ML enrollment rate at 62.6% with 162 students, whereas districts at the lower end have percentages as low as 0.1%, often only being 1 or 2 students. However, Taunton has the highest individual ML reporting 930 students, which is 11.3% of the district population.</p>

          <p> <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/zNZU7/?v=3">Table 1b.</a> Percentage of MLs by CT District</p>
          <p>This table shows the number and percentages of MLs in Connecticut districts. The Danbury School District has the highest percentage of MLs (38%), with about 4,500 students. Stamford School District has a comparable number of MLs, but because its overall student population is larger, MLs only account for 19% of the population. This represents a discrepancy in volume and proportion, suggesting a difference in relative burden concerning districts that overall serve a smaller number of students, but have a higher percentage of students with additional needs.</p>

          <p>
            It is important to consider the diversity of languages spoken by MLs in MA and CT; linguistic diversity and variety play a role in resource allocation, particularly when considering the needs of MLs who speak less common primary languages compared to those who share a primary language with several other MLs.

          <p> <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/Orl66/">Fig. 2b</a> Top Languages Spoken by MLs in CT Districts, 2023-24</p>
          <p>
            This bar chart presents the most prevalent non-English languages spoken by English learners across Connecticut districts in the 2023-24 school year. Spanish is the most spoken language. While Fig. 2a uses data from the 2024-25 school year, the most recent available data for Connecticut districts report the 2023-24 school year. Though the number of individuals may vary in the 2024-2025 school year, the ranking of prevalence is unlikely to change. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The data on languages spoken by MLs demonstrates that the resources needed to support English learners are not identical between the two states. The differing percentages of MLs, in concert with the difference in primary languages spoken by MLs, signify the varying levels of need to support linguistic programs. Thus, it is worth questioning whether per-pupil spending accounts for the additional support required not only as the percentage of MLs within a district increases, but also taking into account their lingual backgrounds.

          <h2>Methods & Sources</h2>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can prepare a JPG or PNG file (preferably with all lower-case text and no spaces in the filename) and upload it directly into your GitHub repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image1.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Next, write an HTML image tag ("img") that points to a source image ("src") stored in your repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image2.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders</h4>

          <p>Use subheader tags (such as "h4") to break up long sections of text without creating a new section.</p>

          <h4>Collaborate with Co-Author</h4>
          <p>Compose and edit your data story in Google Docs, where co-authors can work simultaneously. When you're ready to migrate to GitHub, create ONE data story template in ONE author's GitHub account, because only ONE person can edit at a time. But the GitHub account owner can go to Settings > Collaborators > Add People to invite a co-author by using their GitHub username, as shown below. But be careful not to overwrite each other's edits!</p>

          <img src="screenshots/github-collaborators.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <h4>Change background colors</h4>
          <p> This template uses <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/background/'>Bootstrap background colors</a>. For example, search this "index.html" file for "bg-primary", which sets the navigation bar (line 28), header (line 56), and footer (around line 245) to blue. Changing it to "bg-secondary" switches those colors to gray. Learn about other color options at the link above.</p>

          <h4>Quicker Edits on your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub and waiting for them to appear online, you can quickly make multiple edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps:
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/code-download.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>Install a code editor tool. My favorite free open-source option is the <a href="https://pulsar-edit.dev"> open-source Pulsar text editor</a>, but there are many other options.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer. Since this version is temporarily stored on your local computer, your browser bar will display its location in a local format "file..." rather than the online format "https..."</li>
              <img src="screenshots/index-open-with.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>In your code editor, save changes to your "index.html" file, then refresh your browser to instantly view your changes made on your local computer.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/save-edits.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>After editing, upload the contents of "index.html" from your local computer to your online GitHub account, then view your edits the public web.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>
